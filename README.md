# What is this tool for
This tool was made to edit values of Persona 4 Golden's "fclCombine" ftd files.
The only currently supported files are named and found in "init_free.bin/init/fclTable.bin" as:
- fclCombineTable_NormalSP.ftd (Normal Tab)
- fclCombineTable_ThirdSP.ftd (Triangle Tab)
- fclCombineTable_Fourth.ftd (Cross Tab)
- fclCombineTable_Fifth.ftd (Pentagon Tab)
- fclCombineTable_Sixth.ftd (Hexagon Tab)
- fclCombineTable_Twelfth.ftd (Dodecagon Tab)

# How to Use
1. Extract init/fclTable.bin (or any supported file contained inside of it) from init_free.bin using [Amicitia](https://github.com/TGEnigma/Amicitia/releases).
2. Open it via the File menu at the top
3. Edit the values using the DataGridView on your desired tab
4. Export the current tab or all the data as a folder or fclTable.in
